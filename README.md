Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
ANS. Software engineering is simply the process of designing,testing, building an maintaining applications. Software engineering is important in:
i) Problem solving- engineers gain problem solving skills to solve complex challenges and create effective solutions
ii) Developing innovations- It promotes the creation of new technologies leading to major technological advancements. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANS. 1. The development of various programming languages(eg. fortran and COBOL) has led to signficant progress from use of machine code to modern day programming language.
2. Development Methodologies eg. The Waterfall model which although rigid as one had to complete one phase in a sequence in order to move to another ,was a founational approach to software development.
3. The rise of personal computers  allowed for disseminatin of information on software engineering leading to a surge in software development across consumer markets.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANS. i) Planning- Involves gathering information and documenting it.
ii) Design-involves the creation of a blueprint as well as user interfaces and databases.
iii) Testing- Involves examining the software to ensure it functions properly and meets set requirements.
iv) Deployment- Moving of the software from the testing environment to an operational one.
v) Maintenance- Monitoring the application for issues and provision of frequent problem-solving updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS. i) Waterfall assigns roles strictly to project team members giving the specific duties an responsibilities while the agile model allows for collaboration of the team members on a project.
ii) In waterfall planning is a linear process done at the beggining of a project laying out the objectives and requirements in detail whilst in agile it is a continuous process that occurs throughout the projects life cycle with changes being made as new information emerges.
iii) The waterfall model is suitable for long-term projects with predetermined timelines however agile uses short iterations to deliver value rapidly allowing teams to ajust plans over shorter timeframes 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ANS. Software Developer- Their role is to design, write, test, and maintain codes that build software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures good quality of a software product by testing it throughout the development life cycle and identifying and reporting issues. 
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of a project and ensures on-time delivery of a product made within the provided budget. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANS. They significantly enhance productivity by streamlining the coding process, facilitatinng collaboration and enabling efficient tracking of code changes which allows people to work together on projects more effectively whilst also maintaining a clear history of modifications made. Microsofts visual studio coe is an example of a web-based IDE while Github is an example of a VCS.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ANS. Rapid technological changes- The fast pace of ne programming languages, frameworks and tools rrequiring one to constantly learn. This can be overcome by attending regular workshops and following indusrtry trends.
Collaboration issues- Working with designers and project managers demands strong communication skills ro align priorities and approaches.This can be solved through clear and concise communication with stakeholders and clients
Time constraints- Meeting tight deadlines while maintaining quality is stressful. Through the use of agile methodologies like sprints and iterative feedback helps adapt to changing requirements.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
ANS.i) Unit Testing- It focuses on individual components of the software in order to verify their correct functionality and catch bugs in the early development cycle.
ii) Integration Testing- Tests how different modules interact with one another ensuring smooth data flow and ientify issues arising from their integration.
iii) System Testing- Evaluates the entire software system as a whole to verify  if it meets all specified requirements and functions across different scenarios
iv) Acceptance Testing- Performed by end-users to confirm whether the software meets their needs and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ANS. Prompt Engineering is the process of writing instructions that direct AI models to produce specific responses.
It is important as it allows users to precisely guide the AI towards generating the desire response by carefully crafting prompts. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANS. An example of a vague prompt is "Create an image of a person". This prompt is not specific hence vague. By inputting a prompt such as "Create an image if a middle-aged man with a trouser, brown hair, wearing a white shirt sitting on a rock" 
The vague prompt provide minimal information and leaves too much up to interpretation. This could result to a wide variety of outcomes that might not align with the users expectations. The improve prompt provides the AI with more informaton thus it gives back a more accurate and targeted result.
